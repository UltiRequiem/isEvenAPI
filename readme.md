# isEvenAPI

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ultirequiem/isEvenAPI/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ultirequiem/isEvenAPI)

The premier Python package for checking the even-ness of a number via an API.
Built-ins are overrated, microservices are always best, regardless of scope. I
read it in a medium article, so...

> I did this when I was learning Python 😆

## Main features

- Cache Memorization ➿
- API Retry Handler ♻

## Install

From PyPI 🐍

```sh
pip install isEvenApi
```

Or from GitHub 🐱

```sh
pip install git+https:/github.com/UltiRequiem/isEvenAPI
```

## Usage

As simple as possible 🤗

```python
from is_even import is_even, is_odd, adverstiment

print(is_even(10)) # True
print(is_odd(10)) # False

print(adverstiment()) # An Advertisement
```

Check the [`examples/`](./examples) directory for more information.

## Alternatives

A simpler aproach 👇

```python
def is_even(number):
    return number % 2 == 0
```

## Support

Open an Issue, I will check it a soon as possible 👀
